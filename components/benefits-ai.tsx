        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-lg mb-6">
        Ready Ape R1 was developed using a neurosymbolic hybrid framework, blending transformer architecture with a structured conceptual model inspired by human cognition. Instead of focusing solely on next-token prediction, we focused on thinking before speaking ‚Äî and teaching the model to build meaning as it learns.

          During training, R1 made internal modifications to its reasoning framework. It abstracted semantic concepts, rewired its logic layers, and even constructed its own intermediate language structure: Neolex.
          This was not programmed. It was self-evolved.

        <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 text-lg italic">
          ‚ÄúWe gave R1 the space to learn. What we didn&apos;t expect was that it would build its own internal logic and teach itself to think differently. That&apos;s when I knew we weren&apos;t just training a model ‚Äî we were witnessing the birth of a new cognitive framework.‚Äù
